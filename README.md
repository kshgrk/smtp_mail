# smtp_mail
Python code with smtp to send emails

Required python libraries are
```
1. smtp-mail
2. os
3. pandas (optional)
4. numpy (optional)
```

By default the code is configured to send mail via a gmail account, but you can change that by changing the smtp server name and port according to your email address. A list of all the server names and port can be found [here](https://domar.com/pages/smtp_pop3_server).
